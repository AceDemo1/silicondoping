     Parallel version (MPI), running on     1 processors

   Info: using nr1, nr2, nr3 values from input

   Info: using nr1s, nr2s, nr3s values from input

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = PBE ( 1  4  3  4 0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
